Let me be clear.

A college has multple faculty, students and courses.


A faculty may enter attendance of a students for that day for the course hes teaching for that section for that department.
Eg on 23 Jan 2025 john teaches section A of CSE department of 2nd year currently in 3rd semester of Data structures course for 2 hours. He could also teach in other sections, separtments, years or courses. 

After MSE I is conducted, he can enter the marks of each student. same for MSE II and in case student had to write MSE III, then MSEIII. Same goes for lab.

A student can view his attendance and marks, be it overall ,coursewise per day of all courses. Same for marks. 
If a student has 75 to 85 range attendance, he'll have to pay fine  to attend exam.
If below 75, he's not eligible for exams.

A department has multiple courses. Each course has allloted a teacher to teach to a section of dept. a course could be core elective or dept elective. It could also be open elective which can be taken by all departments of that year expect for some departments.
In case of dept electives, the student can take a course from one group of elective, say business intelligence as professional elective I. Same case for open elective but open elective is singular and doesnt have multiple groups, just a single list of courses which students from some dept can take and some cannot.


Teachers can also modify the attendance  of any day and marks of that student in the couse he's assigned to and dept he's in.


Admin has admin privilages of whole ERP system and can modify anything. Hes the one adding the courses, students, dept, faculty etc.

A student is eligible for MSE III if marks are (MSE I+MSE II<20). MSE I, MSE II, MSEIII are for 20 marks each. task I and task II are 4 marks and task III is for 2 marks. if a studernt has written mse III, then those marks and the higher among MSE II or I is consideered. at the end, total marks are out of 50.


A report viewer can see the statistics of entire db, that is coursewise attendance, pass rate etc
